                <p>
                    I enrolled into MDIS university in October, 2022. First of  all we had orientation week. On a first day we have listened to rector's speech about
                    university procedures, rules, activities and facilities that we have there. After that, we had some tour around university with senior studets who were applied to 
                    every group as volunteers. In our university we have two buildings: old and new, tour began from the new one. There we saw lecture, tutorial rooms and library. Lecture 
                    and tutorial rooms were different in size. Lecture rooms were bigger and could fit more people than tutorial rooms, therefore lessons were conducted only for one group.
                    In addition we also visited canteen and saw the menu with variety of dishes.

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>
                        Then we had a chance to get to know each other. Every group went to the different rooms and in my group we shared to little teams by 2. After we created teams we had some time to talk with
                        each other. When time was up we had to go out to a stage and tolk about our teammates and our teammates talked about us. This way we got some general information about eachother.
